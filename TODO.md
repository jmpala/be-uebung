# TODO List

https://dbdiagram.io/

## Response
- Add status codes
- Add headers

I need a way to return different types of contents
The ones I do care are:
- HTML
- JSON / REST calls
- For the moment all static files are served through the public folder

## View
- search and handle view files from a given DIR on the configs

## Desk
- Needs a size and location

## Users
- Profile picture


## Functionality

- There are 3 roles: Admin, Teamlead and User
- The user can create and delete its own booking
- The teamlead can create and delete its own booking and also the ones of the users
- The admin can do what the teamlead can do and also create, edit and delete user accounts
- The admin can block desks with a "blocking user"
